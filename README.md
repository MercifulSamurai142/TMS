# TMS
Time Management System is used to update schedules and arrange meetings

A company needs to develop a time management system for its executives. The software should let the executives register their daily appointment schedules. The information to be stored includes person(s) with whom meeting is arranged,
venue, the time and duration of the meeting, and the purpose (e.g., for a specific
project work). When a meeting involving many executives needs to be organised,
the system should automatically find a common slot in the diaries of the concerned
executives, and arrange a meeting (i.e., make relevant entries in the diaries of
all the concerned executives) at that time. It should also inform the concerned
executives about the scheduled meeting through e-mail. If no common slot is
available, TMS should help the secretary to rearrange the appointments of the
executives in consultation with the concerned executives for making room for a
common slot. To help the executives check their schedules for a particular day the
system should have a very easy-to-use graphical interface. Since the executives
and the secretaries have their own desktop computers, the time management
software should be able to serve several remote requests simultaneously. Many
of the executives are relative novices in computer usage. Everyday morning the
time management software should e-mail every executive his appointments for
the day. Besides registering their appointments and meetings, the executives might
mark periods for which they plan to be on leave. Also, executives might plan
out the important jobs they need to do on any day at different hours and post
it in their daily list of engagements. Other features to be supported by the TMS
are the followingâ€”TMS should be able to provide several types of statistics such
as which executive spent how much time on meetings. For which project how
many meetings were organised for what duration and how many man-hours were
devoted to it. Also, it should be able to display for any given period of time the
fraction of time that on the average each executive spent on meetings.
